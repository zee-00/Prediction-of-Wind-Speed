Predict Wind Gusts (km/h) using Real Data from Railways (2021 - 2022). Transformed and filtered data by using Python Libraries and  Feature Engineering. In this Project, analyse and set when gust speed increases (50km/h) the Wind Gust value is 1 (means there is a chance of wind gust) and otherwise is 0.
